you should give a brief detail of the feature and also provide some solid reasons of how the

If you know how to fix a certain bug or implement a specific feature, consider `opening a pull
request <https://github.com/izxxr/qord/pulls>`_ for your change.

When making code changes make sure to:

1. Stay consistent with the current code style of library. We suggest formatting your code with Black formatter.
2. Write meaningful and brief commit messages. Don't worry about this one though, The commits would be taken care of when merging the pull request.
3. Try to keep the scope of changes as minimal as possible. Avoid making multiple changes in one pull request.

If a pull request is opened implementing a major change without discussion, It'd likely be rejected.
