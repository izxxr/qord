# Contributing to Qord
As the library is currently under heavy development, Any kind of contribution would be of great value.

By contributing, Not only do you support library but you also get shiny "Contributor" role in our Discord server that grants
you many perks across the server.

## Contributions
You can contribute in three ways.

- Reporting bugs or suggesting features.
- Directly contributing to the codebase.

### Reporting bugs or suggesting features
You can report the bugs that you found and suggest more features by using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nerdguyahmad/qord/issues). Simply create a new issue, Describe your feature or bug and open the issue. Make sure to properly describe the bug. If you are confused about your issue, Ask in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nE9cGtzayA)

### Directly contributing to the codebase
Use [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/nerdguyahmad/qord/pulls) for making code contributions. We assume you already know the basics about how pulls and forks
work on GitHub. However if this is your first time, don't fret! There are several articles online that explain it like [this one](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/).

- Fork the repository.
- Make a new branch.
- Make the code changes.
- Open the pull request.

It is mandatory for contributors to discuss major changes with library maintainers in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nE9cGtzayA). Pull requests that introduce a major change without any discussion with maintainers would simply be rejected.
